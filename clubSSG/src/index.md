# California Video Game Modders Club

## What is modding?

Modding is the act of modifying the files of a video game to create something new with it.

## What games do we mod?

The primary games we mod are large, open-ended games with easily read game-files, such as Bethesda Softworks' Skyrim, or Mojang's Minecraft.

## Why do we mod?

Because it is a good learning experience, since not all of us can make a game from scratch!
