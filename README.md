# Homework 7

## Question 1


Sorry, this was just too complicated for me. Give me a 0/30 on this question.


## Question 2

### (a)

IP Address: 192.168.86.__

Ethernet (Better known as Mac) address: 3c:9c:0f:8d:29:__

I have obfuscated the last two digits of both addresses, simply because I would rather not make it so simple for someone to find these addresses. If they want to get them, they will need to intercept my packets and requests as they travel from my ISP, not on a random GitHub. Hopefully this is enough for credit to be given for the question. I realise I may simply be paranoid, but I am of the mind that safe is better than sorry.

### (b)

Ethernet cannot scale like IP can, so we only use it for local systems.

### (c)

Simply break up those 200KB into smaller 1500 byte pieces and put them back together like a LEGO on the other side. The network layer that should have this functionality is the reciever of the packages, the recipient's computer/machine.

### (d)

TCP has more error checking, and means that websites will appear properly and without errors because everything is checked to have appreared properly, unlike UDP.

## Question 3

### (a)

DNS Servers:
[ '192.168.86.1' ]

### (b)

Address for nexusmods.com
[ '104.22.2.55', '104.22.3.55', '172.67.15.252' ]
