# Homework 7

## Question 1


As you might see, I simply could not get this to work. My processIt.js was not working for me, and I do not understand why. I also only converted one file to MD because I have no clue how to make forms work in MD. I am just very confused. I won't be uploading this to the file server, that's for sure. I am okay with a 0/30 here, I just want to know what I was even supposed to know how to do. I read the slides and couldn't find what I was looking for, so this is all I've got. I don't want to tear out my hair for another full week trying to get this to work.


## Question 2

### (a)

IP Address: 192.168.86.__

Ethernet (Better known as Mac) address: 3c:9c:0f:8d:29:__

I have obfuscated the last two digits of both addresses, simply because I would rather not make it so simple for someone to find these addresses. If they want to get them, they will need to intercept my packets and requests as they travel from my ISP, not on a random GitHub. Hopefully this is enough for credit to be given for the question. I realise I may simply be paranoid, but I am of the mind that safe is better than sorry.

### (b)

Ethernet cannot scale like IP can, so we only use it for local systems.

### (c)

Simply break up those 200KB into smaller 1500 byte pieces and put them back together like a LEGO on the other side. The network layer that should have this functionality is the reciever of the packages, the recipient's computer/machine.

### (d)

TCP has more error checking, and means that websites will appear properly and without errors because everything is checked to have appreared properly, unlike UDP.

## Question 3

### (a)

DNS Servers:
[ '192.168.86.1' ]

### (b)

Address for nexusmods.com
[ '104.22.2.55', '104.22.3.55', '172.67.15.252' ]
