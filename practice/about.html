<h1>California Video Game Modders Club</h1>
<h2>What is modding?</h2>
<p>Modding is the act of modifying the files of a video game to create something new with it.</p>
<h2>What games do we mod?</h2>
<p>The primary games we mod are large, open-ended games with easily read game-files, such as Bethesda Softworks' Skyrim, or Mojang's Minecraft.</p>
<h2>Why do we mod?</h2>
<p>Because it is a good learning experience, since not all of us can make a game from scratch!</p>
